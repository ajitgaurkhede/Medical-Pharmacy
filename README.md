# Medical-Pharmacy
Developed a spring application as medical pharmacy
here I used spring to avoid new keyword, here I implemented following functionality

1. Maintain an inventory of available medicines 
2. Search medicine by name, brand 
3. Maintain a list of doctors 
4. Search a doctor by first name and/or last name 
5. Ability to order a drug if itâ€™s out of stock. 
6. Display list of all pending orders. 
7. Pharmacy details like name, license number, address, contact number are dynamic and should be read from a properties file at start of the application. 
8. Provide a ability to access pharmacy information when needed.
